      "The purpose of this project was to recycle Levi's jeans by transforming them into a new garment. I accomplished this by combining three different denim types, cutting them into square shapes to create a pattern and two different types of textures. The outcome was a completely unique article of clothing created through the recycling of old clothes that would have otherwise been discarded.",
      "Furthermore, I successfully developed a straightforward yet impactful campaign that featured photographs and a video, effectively conveying the project's values and showcasing the final product. In my opinion, this approach represents a smart way to address sustainability in the fashion industry.",

From designing garments and overseeing sample tests to ensuring the final production was flawless, I had a hands-on role in bringing the collection to life.",

      "The project consisted of creating an independent design brand from scratch, taking into consideration the industry, target segment, aesthetics, user profile, materials, typologies, themes, conceptual universe, name, logos, packaging, photography, and fashion film.",
      "To achieve this outcome, we started by exploring the macro trends in the fashion world and aimed to work with a luxury brand where the value would lie in craftsmanship, sustainability, and uniqueness rather than ostentation. We chose the haute couture sector but wanted to target a younger audience as we believed it was a relatively rigid and static industry mainly catering to an older demographic.",
      "The chosen theme revolved around tarot, the mystical realm, spells, and enchantments. Drawing inspiration from medieval and 1900s typologies, we proposed a line of eveningwear that allowed for the interchangeability of garments, resulting in varied outcomes, much like a tarot card reading. Garments with exaggerated sleeves, drapes and  intricately embroidered pieces using different techniques harmoniously combined to create a mystical eveningwear brand that oscillates between moments of romance and a dark, edgy undertone.",

      "The creative genesis to design this collection was the work of Argentine artist Marcela Sinclair.The artist predominantly works with furniture from the 1970s. She employs the objet trouvé technique and creates interventions in the furniture, such as cutouts, subtractions, and hinges, to alter the essence of the object.",
      "Based on this analysis, I primarily focused on deconstructing the tailoring, knitwear, and leather garment sectors. I combined the characteristic elements, construction methods, and accessories of each sector with rigid elements found in the furniture, as well as the duality of colors (interior and exterior of the furniture). However, I did not lose sight of the minimalism that characterizes the artist, while updating the color palette to give it a more modern twist.",
