    description:
      "The aim of this project was to recycle a pair (or more) Levi’s jeans and to transform them into something new. I carried out this task by combining  three different types of denim, cut them in square shapes to create a pattern and  two different types of textures. The result was a whole new different piece of clothing  made by recycling old garments which were ready to be thrown away. Later I managed to create a simple but yet efficient campaign which included pictures and a video manifesting the values behind the project and the product. To me this is a smart way to approach sustainability in the fashion industry.",
